Accessing another person's computer, computer account, files, or data without permission is prohibited. Attempting to circumvent or subvert system or network security measures is prohibited. Creating or running programs that are designed to identify security loopholes, to decrypt intentionally secured data, or to gain unauthorized access to any system is prohibited. Using any means to decode or otherwise obtain restricted passwords or access control information is prohibited. Forging the identity of a user or machine in an electronic communication is prohibited. Saturating network or computer resources to the exclusion of another's use, for example, by overloading the network with traffic such as emails or legitimate (file backup or archive) or malicious (denial of service attack) activity, is prohibited.  Users understand that wireless Internet access is inherently not secure, and users should adopt appropriate security measures when using the Service.

The Service shall not be used for the purpose of accessing, transmitting, or storing material which is considered obscene, libelous or defamatory. Illegal acts may subject users to prosecution by local, state, federal, or international authorities.
